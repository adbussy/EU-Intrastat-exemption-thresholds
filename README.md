# EU-Intrastat-exemption-thresholds
This repository stores the Intrastat exemption thresholds for all EU members from max(1993, date of joining the EU) to 2019.

## Disclaimer
The data was gathered by myslef over the internet. All errors are mine, it is likely some errors have survived my checks, so please be careful when using the data. 

## Description

For each EU member, the file thersholds.csv provides the country-specific exemption/assimilation thresholds. There is one for imports/arrivals and one for exports/dispatches. In every year, traders whose intra-community imports or exports exceed these thresholds are required to submit monthly Intrastat declarations detailing their transactions. These declarations are used to construct international trade statistics.
